# Connect 4 â€“ Java Console Game ðŸŽ®

This is a console-based implementation of the classic **Connect 4** game written in Java. The architecture follows the **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** pattern to cleanly separate game logic, UI, and presentation.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Dynamic board size â€“ configure rows, columns, and win sequence length
- MVP architecture (Model, View, Presenter) for clean code and testability
- Input validation and clear game loop
- Console-based UI with real-time board updates
- Detects win and draw conditions

## Future Improvements
Add graphical UI (JavaFX or Swing)

Save/load game state

AI opponent mode (minimax algorithm)

Unit tests for model logic
